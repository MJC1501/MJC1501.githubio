<p>Hello! My name is Macy Culbertson and I am 15 years old. I am on a mountain bike team and compete across the state! Mountain biking is probably my favorite activity to do! 
I also play lacrosse in the off season. The positions I play are defense, attack, midfield, and goalie, so I guess basically all of them. Goalie is by far my favorite to play! 
I aspire to become a vet one day and currently intern at a local vet clinic! This summer though the vet asked me to work for her!! I  enjoy baking and reading in my free time!
